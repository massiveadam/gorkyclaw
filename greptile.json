  "instructions": "Project context: This repository is a Telegram-first fork of NanoClaw (README calls it GorkyClaw). Core runtime is Node.js + TypeScript with strict safety constraints around action execution. Architecture highlights: `src/index.ts` orchestrates inbound Telegram/WhatsApp flows and agent calls, `src/approved-executor.ts` and infra ops-runner enforce approval gating for mutating actions, `src/container-runner.ts` handles isolated container execution, `src/db.ts` + `src/task-scheduler.ts` manage scheduled tasks and persistence, and `infra/` contains auxiliary services (anthropic-proxy, telegram-gateway, ops-runner). During review, prioritize: (1) security regressions (secret leakage, auth/webhook bypass, command injection, mount/path traversal, sandbox escapes), (2) approval bypass risks for any mutating operation, (3) scheduler/task correctness and idempotency, (4) Telegram command/routing edge cases and user isolation across groups, (5) DB migration safety and backward compatibility, and (6) reliability regressions in long-running/background runs. Treat `.env` and keys as sensitive; never suggest committing secrets. Prefer high-signal findings over style feedback. If possible, map findings to concrete files/functions and suggest minimal fixes. Testing context: uses Node built-in test runner (`npm test`) with TypeScript via tsx; flag missing tests where logic is high-risk.",
